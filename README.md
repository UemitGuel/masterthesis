## Background

When I studied industrial engineering at the RWTH Aachen, I already knew that I´m not going to follow that career path. So I was terrified to spend 6 month
on a project I don´t care about. 
So I tried to choose a topic, where I somehow can write an iOS-app for. In that time I was quite streesed, and in general I was thinking a lot of the impact stress has on a person. 
Luckily, I combined my intererst in that topic with an App Idea. I wanted to use Apple´s Research Kit to see, which impact stress has on my fellow student collegues. This App was never in the App Store, I did all the research with Test-flight by inviting people. But nevertheless, I learned a lot in this project
and I think this kind of bringing technology and science together is a big opportunity for society.
